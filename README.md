Stripboard layouts of modular synthesizer schematics

This is an organised collection of stripboard layouts of modular synthesizers schematics.
I uploaded only the layouts that I finished, soldered and checked - so I am pretty sure they all work. Hopefully there are no mistakes.

Since sometimes I organized the layouts in such a way that is understandable for me but not necessarily for others, I also included the DIYLC files.
In this way I think that anyone can easily access a layout, double check it against the schematics if he feels like and modify it as he wishes. 

Please feel free to fork the repository, to add your own layouts to it and submit a pull request.
